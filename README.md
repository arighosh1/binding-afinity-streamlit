Binding Affinity and Antigenicity Prediction Tool (BAAPT)

Prediction tools for binding affinity and antigenicity are currently webserver-based and do not follow a single software design pattern or reference architecture. Therefore, developing universal models and architectures that may be used as templates for the building of these prediction tools is crucial. As a result, this study explains the Binding Affinity and Antigenicity Prediction Tool (BAAPT)'s concept and pattern, as well as how it is applied to various reverse vaccinology systems.
